    A Python Logging Handler derived class for sending log messages to AMQP.
    
    This Handler is initialized very early in the system, with the logging config,
    which presents a number of challenges.
    - The LoggingPublisherReceiver must wait until the default container is initialized
      in order to be imported or created.
    - There is no good "post initialization" time to do this, so we wait until
      the first emit call comes in from Python.
    - Log messages emitted are queued until they are able to be sent via flush, which
      is called when the LoggingPublisherReceiver/its attached anon process finishes
      initialization.
