    This example shows how people are related.  The primary data (facts) that
    are used to figure everything out are in family.kfb.

    There are four independent rule bases that all do the same thing.  The
    fc_example rule base only uses forward-chaining rules.  The bc_example
    rule base only uses backward-chaining rules.  The bc2_example rule base
    also only uses backward-chaining rules, but with a few optimizations that
    make it run 100 times faster than bc_example.  And the example rule base
    uses all three (though it's a poor use of plans).

    Once the pyke engine is created, all the rule bases loaded and all the
    primary data established as universal facts; there are five functions
    that can be used to run each of the three rule bases: fc_test, bc_test,
    bc2_test, test and general.
